Project no: 4

Project due date: Tuesday, April 4

Project description:  Begin to build an actual game that includes a heads-up-display, a moving player object, and added depth with the painters algorithm.

The easiest part of this project: Working with existing code.

Added Features:
	- A bubble sound effect is played when b is pressed to spawn an user/XML defined number of bubbles
	- Painters algorithm can be applied to multiple any drawable class. Not just a single class
	- modified constructors of all non-players to make locations and velocities random within the limits defined by the user in the XML and size of the world.
